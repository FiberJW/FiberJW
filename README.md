#### 👨🏾‍💻 Who am I?

- Hi, I'm Juwan, and I'm currently working at [Expo](https://expo.dev) on [EAS](https://expo.dev/eas)!
- I love designing apps and building them with React [Native]!
  - My current toy is [Goodweebs](https://github.com/fiberjw/goodweebs), a mobile client for the anime tracking website [AniList.co](https://anilist.co).
- I like to [watch anime](https://anilist.co/user/fiberjw/) and exercise in my free time -- often doing both at the same time.
