#### 👨🏾‍💻 What I Do:

- I'm currently working at [Expo](https://expo.io) on mostly design+front-end things for our managed services.
- When I'm not working [out], I'm either [playing FPS games](https://clips.twitch.tv/UnusualPlayfulSashimiEleGiggle) or [watching anime](https://anilist.co/user/fiberjw/).
- I love doing stuff with React [Native] and coming up with my own designs to implement!
  - My current toy is [Goodweebs](https://github.com/fiberjw/goodweebs), a mobile client for AniList.co.
